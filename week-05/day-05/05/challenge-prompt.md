Split the stacks into groups of 5. Weigh the first group if it is more than 500grams than your counterfeit stack is there. Then split the stacks again into 2 and three stacks. Weigh the stack of 2. If it is still over 200grams weigh each stack and you will find your counterfeit stack.

3 scale uses in an ideal situation.
